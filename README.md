functional programming for music (prototyping) - !! Currently in a flux !!

NOTES//Features
* separation of concerns: context of function (states/time) separate from processing of function
 * => multi temporal: functions can rely on time in various contexts, also local "time scope", different players / different bpm
 * => multiple contexts: e.g. output of functions can at the same time be used for auralization and visualization (timeline)

yada yada.
